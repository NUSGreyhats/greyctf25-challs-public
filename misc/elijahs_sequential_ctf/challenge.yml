description: 'I created a fairly easy competitive programming problem to test your
  algorithm coding skills. Please only use python3, c and cpp.


  The remote judge compiles cpp code using `g++ -DONLINE_JUDGE -fno-tree-ch -O2 -Wall
  -std=c++14`, c code using `gcc -DONLINE_JUDGE -fno-tree-ch -O2 -Wall -std=c99` and
  runs python3 code using `python3.7.8`.


  Good luck and remember to flush your outputs! The rest of the information is in
  the pdf :)
